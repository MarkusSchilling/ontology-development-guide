\subsection{Tools for ontology development}

\begin{description}
    \item[Robot] Robot is a useful tool to process, translate ontologies, extract modules and information from and reason with ontologies.\\ \url{http://robot.obolibrary.org/}
    \item[(py-)horned-owl] The rust library horned-owl and its python interface py-horned-owl are more modern interfaces to a general interface for ontology processing. \\ \url{https://github.com/phillord/horned-owl} and \\ \url{https://github.com/jannahastings/py-horned-owl}
    \item[{\protege}] {\protege} is a free, open-source ontology editor and framework used in research and industry for creating and managing ontologies. It provides a user-friendly, configurable user interface and supports various ontology languages and formats such as OWL/XML, RDF/XML, and Turtle. \\ \url{https://protege.stanford.edu/}
    \item[OntoPanel] Ontopanel is a plugin for the open-source graphical editor diagrams.net that facilitates ontology creation and editing. It includes a set of pipeline tools to foster ontology development on visual, graphical basis, comprising imports and reusage of ontologies, converting diagrams to OWL, verifying diagrams using OWL rules, and mapping data. \cite{ChenOntopanel2022} In particular, it is designed to support domain experts in ontology development. \\ \url{https://github.com/BAMresearch/Ontopanel-backend}
